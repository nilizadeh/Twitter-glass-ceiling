Twitterâ€™s Glass Ceiling: The Effect of Perceived Gender on Online Visibility
#######################

We obtained our dataset from Twitter gardenhose (10% sample of Twitter). 
You can find the original tweet_ids in our dataset available here at: http://www.icwsm.org/2016/datasets/datasets/.
The summary of our dataset including all the attributes used in our statistical analysis is published as summ_data.csv.


We used firstnames documented in 1900- 2013 U.S. Census to detect Twitter users' gender by their firstnames.

We also used Face++ (http://www.faceplusplus.com/) to detect users' gender by their profile pictures.

The statistical analysis is done in R.
